## What

Elixir experiments.

## How

Following Elixir tutorials at [here](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/introduction.html).

## Syntactical Learnings

- String concatenation: `<>`
- Function parantheses can be omitted. `length(list)` and `length list` are equivalent.
- Uses `#{variable_name}` for interpolation. Similar to Python's `f` strings.
- Anonymous functions using `fn` and `end`. Similar to Python's `lambda`.
- do/end as delimiters instead of a semicolor or curly brace.
- Maps need `%{}` instead of simple `{}`.
- Lists are implemented using Linked list, unlike Python's dynamic array implementation.
- Elixir tuples are better aligned with Python's list.

## Philosophical and Architectural Learnings

### Immutability

Memory efficiency, thanks to the immutable semantics of the language.
